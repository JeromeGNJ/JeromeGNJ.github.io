  description: Amazon EC2 Spot instances allow users to bid on spare computing capacity at a discounted rate. However, the availability and pricing of these instances are market-driven and can fluctuate, leading to potential termination of instances with little notice. This project developed an analytics framework to retrieve historical spot price data through Web APIs, build predictive models using linear, polynomial, multiple linear, and KNN regression, and forecast current availability. Data for the current scenario is retrieved through web scraping, with visualization done using ggplot.
